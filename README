Device-Yeelight

Yeelight smart LED products support remote control through WiFi. When user
received the smart LED device for the first time, he/she needs to complete a
configuration procedure to provision the router's SSID and password to the
device. This procedure is normally called SmartConfig or QuickConnect. Due to
security consideration, the protocol used for SmartConfig is proprietary, which
means no 3rd party could know about it or use it. However, after the device is
connected to the router, it can be seen by all the devices under the same
network, thus could also be controlled by 3rd party equipment that understands
the inter-operation control protocol.

This Perl module implements local device discovery via Yeeling specific SSDP
protocol and sending commands via control protocol in the JSON format.
